placemappergame
===============

This is a (very early) work in progress of a game that tests your knowledge of places.

The name of the location is in the top left. You place the marker on a map and then click submit.

If you get it right, it adds a checkmark and updates the location to a new one. Else, it tells you how far you are off.


Right now it's just the bars of Madison. May potentially update this to other things/cities depending on interest.
